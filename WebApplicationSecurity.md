# In the early days

In the early days, the purpose of the World Wide Web(WWW) was to show static documents straight on from server to browser. So there wasn't any user authentication(which we know as a login). So most of the security threats were on the web server software.

# But these days..

But these days websites became more upgraded. Now there are user authentication and more on.
