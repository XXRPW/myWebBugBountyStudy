In this reading, it will explain many defense mechanisms


# Handling User Access
Most web applications use these mechanisms when they are handling access:
>Authentication
<br>

>Session management
<br>


>Access control<br>

A defeat in any of these mechanism will lead to a gain of unrestircted access to the attacker.

### Authentication
Authentication mechanism is logically the most basic dependency in an application's handling of user access. because of the fact that it is the most basic dependency, the range of vulnerability is also huge. It has huge range of defects in both design and implementation. 

> Tip : When you are attacking a website, you should give a big atten to these authentication-related functions and a lot of times you get access to sensitive data and functionality by the attack on these systems.


### Session Management
